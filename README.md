I'd like to tell you a little about myself. I have been working in blockchain for 5 years and machine learning for 8 years.
I'm a developer who knows the value of time, works very hard, and always provides work on time, and prove myself with great skills. I always think that when both clients and developers trust each other, the project can succeed, and also think that if an excellent developer, has to own wide-knowledge.
My skills will be updated go on and I will try to prepare myself to become a top developer continuously. 

I'm ready to handle any product development combining extensive and I'm up to date on all modern development trends. I pride myself on my unique skills which is why I'll do my best to work for my clients.
